• Developed a quantitative trading system applying cointegration analysis (Engle-Granger method) and Z-score normalization to exploit mean-reversion opportunities in NSE Information Technology sector stocks.

• Engineered an ML prediction layer using Random Forest with features including rolling Z-scores, lagged spread values, and momentum metrics, optimizing lookback windows (40-100 days) through grid search on training data.

• Implemented robust performance measurement calculating risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio), drawdown analysis, and trade-level P&L tracking with realistic transaction cost assumptions of 0.1% per round trip.
